                <p>Hey there, I'm Isa and I'm so happy you're taking some time to get to know me and my work better!

                    Welcome, I hope you enjoy your brief stay and that your visit encourages you to contact me soon.
                    
                    Photography has been a huge part of my life since 2014, when I was still a teenager borrowing my friend's camera, playing with some Instagram filters back when Instagram still had that vintage aesthetic, traveling to the country side of Brazil and shooting the green of the trees and my family members. 
                    
                    Then I got my first own camera on my 15th birthday, while also on my first international trip: Los Angeles, CA. Since then, I realized three big things: first is that traveling brings me so much joy; second is that you can't have m&m's for lunch for days (trust me, it doesn't matter how much you love them, your stomach WILL get sick lol); and the third one is that holding a camera may be one of my biggest sources of fun.
                    
                    And that's the philosophy I put onto my sessions: I want us to have FUN together. 
                    
                    I think people tend to understand photography by its simpler definition: someone presses a button, that captures a pose, freezes an image and there we have it: a picture. But I believe in more than that. I believe in real feelings, in movement, motion. In a tiny second of a beautiful moment that could easily slip out of our minds, if it was not captured on the right time. The heart creates it, the camera captures it. And that short frame of a second will now be a beautiful memory for eternity. And thats because that feeling DESERVES to be remembered as it is.
                    
                    When you trust me to put into the lenses a moment that is important for you, you can be sure that I will do my best to capture all the feelings just how they are. I want you to feel comfortable with the idea that youre not just hiring a photographer, you are also getting to know a passionate human being that cant wait to know your story and build a bond with you!
                    
                    Im currently booking for couples sessions, engagement sessions and single portraits. Please dont hesitate to contact me whenever.
                    
                    It was great having you here, I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

                        <p>I have no words to describe Isa's work. With such an extreme care she was able to capture all the emotions of the happiest day of my life. The wedding pictures ended up so beautiful, it was the best way to eternize our moment.</p>

                        <p>I hired Isa for my last minute wedding, she was more than punctual, responsible and gave a lot of attention to all the details in the event, I was so happy with the results that it even looked like my last minute ceremony was planned for over a year.</p>
